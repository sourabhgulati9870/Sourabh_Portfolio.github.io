                    the solar system. Sun provides us with sunlight and solar energy. We can use solar energy to produce eleçtricity. Sun is crucial for the survival of life on earth. In many cultures around the world, sun is treated as God. Everyone
                    prefers a bright sunny day as it allows us to participate in any outdoor activity like a long drive or excursion. As the earth rotates, one hemisphere is exposed to sun leading to day while the other experiences night and hence the
                    phenomenon of day and night occurs. Although, sun has various advantages,it also has drawback of UV rays which can harm us.</p>
